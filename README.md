Progress made
Edited the teplate which was inaccessible as the sidebar and topbar was controlled by a customizer button
It was edited so that both topbar and sidebar is fully functional
Mobile view was also worked on but not perfected 
In My opinion the topbar is the most important part of the design due to the inaccessibility via the template
The other components are easily accesible
-Want to adjust the width at which mobile view comes up
-Little finishing touches as to the modal position.
Would finish dashboard in the next few days
